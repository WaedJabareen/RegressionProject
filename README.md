#   Individual Rate  Prediction Using Regression

- A machine learning regression model that is trained on Rate-PUF dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight (CCIIO)
- We are doing supervised learning here and our aim is to do prediction
- During our journey we'll understand the important tools needed to develop a powerful ML model
- Our aim is to play with tools like cross validation, GridSearchCV, Random Forests and Pipelines to reach our goal
- We'll evaluate the performance of each of our model using RMSE and also tune hyper parameters to further optimize our model
-  We'll validate our predictions against our test dataset and conclude our learnings


**To do an end-to-end Machine Learning project we need to do the following steps**

1.  Understand the requirements of the business.
2.	Acquire the dataset.
3.	Visualize the data to understand it better and develop our intuition.
4.	Pre-process the data to make it ready to feed to our ML model.
5.	Try various models and train them. Select one that we find best.
6.	Fine-tune our model by tuning hyper-parameters
7.	Save and load model to make prediction.
