#   Individual Rate  Prediction Using Regression
•	A machine learning regression model that is trained on California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository.
•	We are doing supervised learning here and our aim is to do predictive analysis
•	During our journey we'll understand the important tools needed to develop a powerful ML model
•	Our aim is to play with tools like cross validation, GridSearchCV, Random Forests and Pipelines to reach our goal
•	We'll evaluate the performance of each of our model using RMSE and also tune hyper parameters to further optimize our model
•	We'll validate our predictions against our test dataset and conclude our learnings
